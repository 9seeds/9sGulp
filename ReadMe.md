# 9sGulp â€” WordPress Gulp/PostCSS Workflow

Acknowledgement: 
This is a fork of Ahmad Awais' WPGulp https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp if you're looking for a starting point for your own workflow, that's probably the better place to start. If you're curious how some people tweak that boilerplate, well this is an example of that but don't except this to always work out of the box.

## 9seeds Modifications
- Modified to use PostCSS (gulp-postcss)
- Added Bourbon and Bourbon-neat via NPM
- Moved BrowserList to package.json
- Tweaked a few naming conventions
- Added Composer.json for PHPCS and WP-Enforcer

## @TODOs
- Need to add gulp tasks for PHPCS/PHPCBF
- Need to add SVG sprite builder
- Need to confirm SASS Sourcemaps working as they should
